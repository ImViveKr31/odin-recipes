        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 ripe pears - peeled, cored, and cubed </li>
            <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>7 ounces Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh pasta dough</li>
        </ul>

        <span><h2>Directions</h2></span>
        <h4><strong>Step 1</strong> </h4>
        <p>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add pears and thyme; cook,<br>stirring often, until pears have softened, about 10 minutes. Crumble Gorgonzola<br>cheese over pears; cook and stir until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet<br>from heat and cool filling completely.</p>
        <h4><strong>Step 2</strong> </h4>
        <p>Cut pasta dough into 3 equal pieces. Flatten the first piece of dough on a floured<br>work surface; roll with a rolling pin 5 or 6 times. Turn the dough 45 degrees and<br>roll again, 5 to 6 times. Keep rolling and turning in the same direction until<br>dough has a consistent thickness of about 1/16-inch. Repeat with remaining 2 <br>pieces of pasta dough.</p>
        <h4><strong>Step 3</strong> </h4>
        <p>Gently transfer 1 pasta sheet to a floured surface and cut in half to form 2 evenly<br>sized rectangles. Drop about 1 teaspoon filling onto 1 rectangle, spacing the<br>filling about 1-inch apart. Brush the spaces around the filling with water.</p>
        <h4><strong>Step 4</strong> </h4>
        <p>Lay the second rectangle on top of the first. Gently squeeze out the air around<br>the filling and press firmly with your hands to seal the edges and all dough<br>around the filling.</p>
        <h4><strong>Step 5</strong> </h4>
        <p>Cut square ravioli shapes using a ravioli cutter. Transfer the ravioli to a floured<br>plate or board. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Let the ravioli stand<br>for about 30 minutes.</p>
        <h4><strong>Step 6</strong> </h4>
        <p>Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil; gently add ravioli, working in<br>batches. Cook until ravioli float to the top, about 3 minutes. Remove using a<br>slotted spoon and transfer to a warm bowl.</p>
